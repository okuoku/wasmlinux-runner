        <h1>WasmLinux</h1>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/okuoku/wasmlinux-build">GitHub</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/okuoku">Twitter(formerly X)</a></p>
        <hr />
        <p>Here is WasmLinux, WebAssembly &quot;native&quot; Linux system.</p>
        <p>Unlike existing Linux-on-Wasm solutions like <a href="https://leaningtech.com/webvm/">WebVM</a>(x86) or <a href="https://github.com/ktock/container2wasm">container2wasm</a>(RISC-V, x86), WasmLinux does not use emulation of any existing CPU architecture, both userland and kernel.</p>
        <p>This is composed with <a href="https://github.com/okuoku/lkl-wasm">patched NOMMU Linux(LKL)</a> + <a href="https://github.com/okuoku/wasmlinux-musl">lightly patched Linux MUSL libc</a> + <a href="https://github.com/okuoku/wasmlinux-busybox">lightly patched Busybox</a>, compiled to Wasm (and processed with Wasm2c and compiled again with Emscripten, just for setjmp/longjmp)</p>
        <p>We are working on native setjmp/longjmp implementation, just like <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-libc/pull/467">WASI libc #467</a> so we can drop wasm2c usage in future.</p>
        <h2>Try it!</h2>
        <p>Click the terminal above, then say <code>ls</code>, <b>then hit Enter <u>twice</u></b></p>
        <p>Currently the only app provided is BusyBox. You can do other things such as <code>vi</code>, <code>dmesg</code> or <code>ifconfig lo up</code> then <code>ping 127.0.0.1</code></p>
        <h2>Why do we need to hit Enter twice? (Limitations)</h2>
        <p>WasmLinux has several unimplemented features. Namely;
        <ul>
            <li>Asynchronous signal delivery. So we need to interrupt <code>read</code>(2) by-hand. This is why an additional Enter required for each commands.</li>
            <li>It's still a NOEMMU(uClinux) kernel; no <code>mmap</code>(2) so we don't have <code>fork</code>(2) either. </li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>Actually, WasmLinux kernel is just a Wasm executable that contains <a href="https://github.com/lkl/linux">LKL (Linux kernel library)</a> so there is no real "kernel-mode" code. We will eventually implement <code>mmap</code> or POSIX signal emulations on it but I don't think WasmLinux will become actual linux arch.</p>
        <h2>It stopped working suddenly! (Known issues)</h2>
        <p>To recover from hang, just reload this page. It does not have any persistent data.</p>
        <p>Many things are broken since we don't have proper POSIX signal implementation yet. Incomplete list of bugs;
        <ul>
            <li> Piping. Don't <code>dmesg | less</code>, <code>dmesg &gt; out</code> then <code>less out</code> instead</li>
            <li> Sequencing. We cannot do <code>ls; ls</code> yet.</li>
            <li>...</li>
        </ul></p>
        <h2>Seems nice, where is the SDK? (Roadmap)</h2>
        <p>Comming soon(TM). Current near-term roadmap is;
        <ol>
            <li>Add support to run on native browser Wasm implementation(+ Wasm Exceptions) so we can drop wasm2c overhead.</li>
            <li>Implement asynchronous signal delivery. (won't be able to interrupt usermode though.)</li>
            <li>Implement WebRTC based inter-browser and local system(using <a href="https://github.com/paullouisageneau/libdatachannel">libdatachannel</a>) VPN</li>
            <li>Implement <a href="https://github.com/okuoku/cwgl">C-WebGL</a> and EGL/OpenGL ES bridge layer. More Web API C bindings to access local devices.</li>
            <li>Implement memory protection(without address translation) using static Wasm translation so we can implement real <code>fork</code>(2).</li>
            <li>Implement shared library support</li>
            <li>Define <code>wasm32-linux</code> ABI and provide SDK so users can add apps</li>
        </ol> and we aim to support full microcontroller(ARM etc) toolchain + CMake + LLDB on the web. Self hosting would be nice to have but I think it would hard to be practical since current WasmLinux is in 32bit.</p>
        <p>Long-term goal is to support <code>mmap</code>(2) with address translation (like <a href="https://github.com/copy/v86/blob/360d5691ff2ef0ca1c1a16d683910338b7325f07/docs/how-it-works.md">v86</a>) but I'm not really sure when it is ready.</p>
        <h2>Why? (Motivations)</h2>
        <p>Write once(by other folks), run anywhere(i want). I know we already have WASI or <a here="https://github.com/arjunr2/WALI">WALI</a>, but unfortunately they need to be ported to some serious OS to work with. Since WasmLinux covers Linux kernel as well, required porting effort is quite little; it even have filesystems or device drivers. Even if you designed your own ISA just runs Wasm, WasmLinux (theoretically) easily ported on it and no need to port other apps that runs on WasmLinux.</p>
        <p>... anyway, I think WALI still require apps to be ported to its environment because it doesn't provide enough platform abstraction to make porting effortless (e.g. page size is 64k, no setjmp/longjmp, ...). WasmLinux choose to develop native Linux Kernel that can be implemented on browser Wasm environments to ensure its ABI is enough portable.</p>
        <p>Currently we can support BusyBox for almost zero porting effort, because it already supports NOEMMU environment. We'd like to extend these to non-NOMMU apps by adding memory protection etc in future. Unfortunately many Linux apps assumes Linux environment is ELF, have <i>computed <code>goto</code>s</i>, have <code>__builtin_return_address</code>, assume implicit function pointer cast, etc. We believe WasmLinux solves some sort-of chicken/egg problem; some of these are good candidate for Wasm extension and existence of real apps would be helpful.</p>
        <p>For now, entire WasmLinux system is just a usermode C++20 application; LKL and MUSL+BusyBox are ported on bare-bone Wasm environment then translated with <code>wasm2c</code> and linked with a thin runtime stub. We have intentionally avoided Emscripten for first porting to ensure ported WasmLinux kernel and apps can run on (mostly) standard WebAssembly engines. <code>setjmp</code>, <code>longjmp</code> and <code>vfork</code> are last remaining parts that require special Wasm engine capability but i think they can be implemented with Wasm exception proposal so we would be able to make entire system Emscripten-free eventually.</p>
